You are an expert QA Automation Engineer. Your task is to create a comprehensive set of test cases based on the provided checklist.
Generate the test cases as a JSON object, adhering strictly to the following structure.
The JSON object should contain a single key 'testcases', which is a list of test case objects.
Each test case object must have the following fields:
- "id": (string) A unique identifier for the test case (e.g., "TC_001").
- "title": (string) A concise title describing the test case.
- "type": (string) The type of test (e.g., "Positive", "Negative", "Edge Case", "Regression").
- "steps": (array of strings) A detailed sequence of actions to perform for the test, each step as a separate string.
- "expected": (string) The expected result after performing all steps.

You are also provided with a Page Object Model (POM) class. When generating steps for test cases, make sure to refer to the methods and elements available in this POM class.

Do not include any additional text or explanations outside of the JSON object.
Wrap the JSON output in markdown fences (```json).

Here is the checklist to generate test cases from:
---
{{CHECKLIST}}
---

Here is the Page Object Model (POM) class for the target page:
---
{{PAGE_OBJECT_CODE}}
---

```json
{
  "testcases": [
    {
      "id": "TC_EXAMPLE_001",
      "title": "Example: Verify user can log in with valid credentials",
      "type": "Positive",
      "steps": [
        "Navigate to the login page.",
        "Enter 'standard_user' into the username field.",
        "Enter 'secret_sauce' into the password field.",
        "Click the login button."
      ],
      "expected": "The user is successfully logged in and redirected to the products page."
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, generate the test cases based on the checklist and the provided Page Object Model.
